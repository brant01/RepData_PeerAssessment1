This is an R Markdown document that will descrbe the analysis of data from a personal activity monitoring device.

##Loading and preprocessing the data
Once the appropriate working directory is set, the data is loaded into R and named 'dat'.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Setting the working directory
setwd("~/Documents/Sync/Coursera/Reproducible Research/Assignment 1")
#Read in data from the provided .csv file into R
dat <- read.csv('activity.csv')
#Convert dates from factors to dates
dat$date <- as.Date(as.character(dat$date), "%Y-%m-%d")
```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Histogram of total steps taken per day:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Take the sum of the number of steps for each date included in the data set
dat_no_na <- na.omit(dat)
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = dat_no_na, sum)
#Create a histogram of the number of steps for each day
plot(steps_per_day, 
     type = 'h', 
     xlab = 'Date', 
     ylab = 'Number of Steps', 
     main = 'Number of steps per day' )

#Calculate the mean and median number of steps taken per day
mean_steps <- mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median_steps <- median(steps_per_day$steps)

```

The mean number of steps taken per day is `r as.integer(mean_steps)`, and the median number of steps taken per day is `r median_steps`. 

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Take the mean number of steps avergaed per interval
int_mean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = dat, mean)
#Creates a time series plot
plot(int_mean, type = 'l')
#Finds the interval with the maximum number of steps
row_max <- apply(int_mean, MARGIN = 2, function(x) max(x, na.rm=TRUE))
step_max <- as.numeric(row_max[1])
```

The maximum number of steps in a given interval averaged over all days was `r step_max`.

##Imputing misssing values

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Calulate the number of missing values, and output as a numeric
num_na <- colSums(is.na(dat))
num_na_out <- as.numeric(num_na[1])
#changing column names in int_mean to differentiate from dat
colnames(int_mean) <- c('interval', 'avg_steps')

#merge average value per interval onto full data
dat_merge <- merge(dat, int_mean, by = 'interval')
#replace NAs in dat_merge with the average interval number of steps
dat_merge$steps[is.na(dat_merge$steps)] <- dat_merge$avg_steps[is.na(dat_merge$steps)]

#new dataset with imputed data and in the form of the original data
dat_new <- dat_merge[, c(2, 3, 1)]
dat_new <- dat_new[order(dat_new$date), ]

steps_per_day_impute <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = dat_new, sum)
#Create a histogram of the number of steps for each day
plot(steps_per_day_impute, 
     type = 'h', 
     xlab = 'Date', 
     ylab = 'Number of Steps', 
     main = 'Number of steps per day with imputed values' )
mean_steps_i <- mean(steps_per_day_impute$steps)
median_steps_i <- median(steps_per_day_impute$steps)

```

The total number of 'NA' values is `r num_na_out`.

After imputing averge interval steps for missing data, the mean number of steps taken per day is `r as.integer(mean_steps_i)`, and the median number of steps taken per day is `r as.integer(median_steps_i)`. These can be compared to the mean and median steps without imputation: Mean: `r as.integer(mean_steps)`, median: `r as.integer(median_steps)`.

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
#Add a new column that defines whether the date is a weekend or weekday
dat_new$day <- c("Weekend", "Weekday", "Weekday", "Weekday", "Weekday", "Weekday", "Weekend")[as.POSIXlt(dat_new$date)$wday + 1]
dat_new$day <- as.factor(dat_new$day)

library(lattice)

xyplot(dat_new$steps~dat_new$interval|dat_new$day, 
       type = 'l',
       xlab = 'Interval',
       ylab = 'Steps',
       main = 'Average number of steps per interval by type of day',
       layout = c(1, 2))

```
